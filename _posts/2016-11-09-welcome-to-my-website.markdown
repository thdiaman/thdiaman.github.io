Hello and welcome to the blog section my website!
This is my first blog post, and there will hopefully be more to come.

Since this is my first blog post, it's only fair to start by noting down
the resources used to create this website. This website is created using
a static site generator named <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>
and originally used the
<a href="https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template">Steve's No-Good-Very-Bad Jekyll Theme</a>,
which --by the way-- is actually quite good.
The site is hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
and you can even check its source in a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/thdiaman/thdiaman.github.io">repo</a>.
