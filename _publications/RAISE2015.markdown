The problem of Software Reliability Prediction is attracting the attention of several 
researchers during the last few years. Various classification techniques are proposed in 
current literature which involve the use of metrics drawn from version control systems 
in order to classify software components as defect-prone or defect-free. In this paper, 
we create a novel genetic fuzzy rule-based system to efficiently model the 
defect-proneness of each component. The system uses a Mamdani-Assilian inference engine 
and models the problem as a one-class classification task. System rules are constructed 
using a genetic algorithm, where each chromosome represents a rule base (Pittsburgh 
approach). The parameters of our fuzzy system and the operators of the genetic algorithm 
are designed with regard to producing interpretable output. Thus, the output offers not 
only effective classification, but also a comprehensive set of rules that can be easily 
visualized to extract useful conclusions about the metrics of the software.
