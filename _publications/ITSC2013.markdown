The effect of traffic in routing, either for individuals or fleets, becomes more and 
more noticeable as the social, economical, and the ecological effects that it has, seem 
to be crucial. Forecasting travel times is an interesting, yet challenging problem, 
which if taken into careful consideration, could have a positive impact on the 
effectiveness of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Upon analyzing the problem and 
describing its variances, this paper compares different methodologies on traffic 
prediction, along with analyzing the effect of metrics, such as Principal Component 
Analysis and Cross Correlation, when interpreting traffic data. We evaluate known 
literature methods along with a new prototype algorithmic variation of STARIMA, based on 
the use of global Coefficient of Determination, against two diverse datasets. The 
benchmarking results, which are promising, are discussed with respect to the distinct 
characteristics of the two datasets.
