Automating the localization of software bugs that do not lead to crashes is a difficult
task that has drawn the attention of several researchers. Several popular methods
follow the same approach; function call traces are collected and represented as graphs,
which are subsequently mined using subgraph mining algorithms in order to provide a
ranking of potentially buggy functions-nodes. Recent work has indicated that the
scalability of state-of-the-art methods can be improved by reducing the graph dataset
using tree edit distance algorithms. The call traces that are closer to each other, but
belong to different sets, are the ones that are most significant in localizing bugs.
In this work, we further explore the task of selecting the most significant traces, by
proposing different call trace selection techniques, based on the Stable Marriage
problem, and testing their effectiveness against current solutions. Upon evaluating our
methods on a real-world dataset, we prove that our methodology is scalable and
effective enough to be applied on dynamic bug detection scenarios.
