The availability of code snippets in online repositories like GitHub has led to an uptick in code reuse,
this way further supporting an open-source component-based development paradigm. The likelihood of code
reuse rises when the code components or snippets are of high quality, especially in terms of readability,
making their integration and upkeep simpler. Toward this direction, we have developed a dataset of code
snippets that takes into account both the functional and the quality characteristics of the snippets. The
dataset is based on the CodeSearchNet corpus and comprises additional information, including static
analysis metrics, code violations, readability assessments, and source code similarity metrics. Thus, using
this dataset, both software researchers and practitioners can conveniently find and employ code snippets
that satisfy diverse functional needs while also demonstrating excellent readability and maintainability.
