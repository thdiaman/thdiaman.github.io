Developers nowadays are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to
assist them with coding tasks, inspired by the promise of efficiency and the advanced capabilities
they offer. However, this raises important questions about the ease of integration and the safety
of incorporating these tools into the development process. To investigate these questions, this
paper examines a set of ChatGPT conversations. Upon annotating the conversations according to the
intent of the developer, we focus on two critical aspects: firstly, the ease with which developers
can produce suitable source code using ChatGPT, and, secondly, the quality aspects of the generated
source code, determined by the compliance to standards and best practices. We research both the
quality of the generated code itself and its impact on the project of the developer. Our results
indicate that ChatGPT can be a useful tool for software development when used with discretion.
