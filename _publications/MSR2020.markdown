The full integration of online repositories in the contemporary software development 
process promotes remote work and remote collaboration. Apart from the apparent benefits, 
online repositories offer a deluge of data that can be utilized to monitor and improve 
the software development process. Towards this direction, we have designed and implemented 
a platform that analyzes data from GitHub in order to compute a series of metrics that 
quantify the contributions of project collaborators, both from a development as well as an 
operations (communication) perspective. We analyze contributions in an evolutionary manner 
throughout the projects' lifecycle and track the number of coding violations generated, 
this way aspiring to identify cases of software development that need closer monitoring 
and (possibly) further actions to be taken. In this context, we have analyzed the 3000 
most popular Java GitHub projects and provide the data to the community.
