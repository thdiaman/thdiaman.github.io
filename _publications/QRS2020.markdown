Most software teams nowadays host their projects online and monitor software development 
in the form of issues/tasks. This process entails communicating through comments and 
reporting progress through commits and closing issues. In this context, assigning new 
issues, tasks or bugs to the most suitable contributor largely improves efficiency. Thus, 
several automated issue assignment approaches have been proposed, which however have major 
limitations. Most systems focus only on assigning bugs using textual data, are limited to 
projects explicitly using bug tracking systems, and may require manually tuning parameters 
per project. In this work, we build an automated issue assignment system for GitHub, taking 
into account the commits and issues of the repository under analysis. Our system aggregates 
feature probabilities using a neural network that adapts to each project, thus not requiring 
manual parameter tuning. Upon evaluating our methodology, we conclude that it can be 
efficient for automated issue assignment.
