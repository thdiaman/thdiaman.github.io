As more and more software teams use online issue tracking systems to collaborate on software projects,
the accurate assignment of new issues to the most suitable contributors may have significant impact on
the success of the project. As a result, several research efforts have been directed towards automating
this process to save considerable time and effort. However, most approaches focus mainly on software
bugs and employ models that do not sufficiently take into account the semantics and the non-textual
metadata of issues and/or produce models that may require manual tuning. A methodology that extracts
both textual and non-textual features from different types of issues is designed, providing a Jira
dataset that involves not only bugs but also new features, issues related to documentation, patches,
etc. Moreover, the semantics of issue text are effectively captured by employing a topic modelling
technique that is optimised using the assignment result. Finally, this methodology aggregates
probabilities from a set of individual models to provide the final assignment. Upon evaluating this
approach in an automated issue assignment setting using a dataset of Jira issues, the authors conclude
that it can be effective for automated issue assignment.
