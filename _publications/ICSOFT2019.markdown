The sharing and growth of open source software packages in the npm JavaScript (JS)
ecosystem has been exponential, not only in numbers but also in terms of interconnectivity,
to the extend that often the size of dependencies has become more than the size of the
written code. This reuse-oriented paradigm, often attributed to the lack of a standard
library in node and/or in the micropackaging culture of the ecosystem, yields interesting
insights on the way developers build their packages. In this work we view the dependency
network of the npm ecosystem from a “culinary” perspective. We assume that dependencies are
the ingredients in a recipe, which corresponds to the produced software package. We employ
network analysis and information retrieval techniques in order to capture the dependencies
that tend to co-occur in the development of npm packages and identify the communities that
have been evolved as the main drivers for npm’s exponential growth.
