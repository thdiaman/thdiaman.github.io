The increase of the adoption of IoT devices and the contemporary problem of food 
production have given rise to numerous applications of IoT in agriculture. These 
applications typically comprise a set of sensors that are installed in open fields 
and measure metrics, such as temperature or humidity, which are used for irrigation 
control systems. Though useful, most contemporary systems have high installation and 
maintenance costs, and they do not offer automated control or, if they do, they are 
usually not interpretable, and thus cannot be trusted for such critical applications. 
In this work, we design Vital, a system that incorporates a set of low-cost sensors, 
a robust data store, and most importantly an explainable AI decision support system. 
Our system outputs a fuzzy rule-base, which is interpretable and allows fully 
automating the irrigation of the fields. Upon evaluating Vital in two pilot cases, 
we conclude that it can be effective for monitoring open-field installations.
