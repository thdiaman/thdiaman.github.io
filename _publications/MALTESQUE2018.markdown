The popularity of open-source software repositories has led to a new reuse paradigm, 
where online resources can be thoroughly analyzed to identify reusable software components. 
Obviously, assessing the quality and specifically the reusability potential of source code 
residing in open software repositories poses a major challenge for the research community. 
Although several systems have been designed towards this direction, most of them do not 
focus on reusability. In this paper, we define and formulate a reusability score by 
employing information from GitHub stars and forks, which indicate the extent to which 
software components are adopted/accepted by developers. Our methodology involves applying 
and assessing different state-of-the-practice machine learning algorithms, in order to 
construct models for reusability estimation at both class and package levels. Preliminary 
evaluation of our methodology indicates that our approach can successfully assess 
reusability, as perceived by developers.
