Nowadays, software development has been greatly influenced by question-answering 
communities, such as Stack Overflow. A new problem-solving paradigm has emerged, as 
developers post problems they encounter that are then answered by the community. In this 
paper, we propose a methodology that allows searching for solutions in Stack Overflow, 
using the main elements of a question post, including not only its title, tags, and 
body, but also its source code snippets. We describe a similarity scheme for these 
elements and demonstrate how structural information can be extracted from source code 
snippets and compared to further improve the retrieval of questions. The results of our 
evaluation indicate that our methodology is effective on recommending similar question 
posts allowing community members to search without fully forming a question.
