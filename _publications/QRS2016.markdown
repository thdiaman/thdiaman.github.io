The popularity of open source software repositories and the highly adopted paradigm of
software reuse have led to the development of several tools that aspire to assess the
quality of source code. However, most software quality estimation tools, even the ones
using adaptable models, depend on fixed metric thresholds for defining the ground truth.
In this work we argue that the popularity of software components, as perceived by
developers, can be considered as an indicator of software quality. We present a generic
methodology that relates quality with source code metrics and estimates the quality of
software components residing in popular GitHub repositories. Our methodology employs two
models: a one-class classifier, used to rule out low quality code, and a neural network,
that computes a quality score for each software component. Preliminary evaluation
indicates that our approach can be effective for identifying high quality software
components in the context of reuse.
