Nowadays developers search online for reusable solutions to their problems in
the form of source code snippets. As this paradigm can greatly reduce the time
and effort required for software development, several systems have been proposed
to automate the process of finding reusable snippets. However, contemporary
systems also have certain limitations; several of them do not support queries in
natural language and/or they only output API calls, thus limiting their ease of
use. Moreover, the retrieved snippets are often not grouped according to the
APIs/libraries used, while they are only assessed for their functionality,
disregarding their readability. In this work, we design a snippet mining
methodology that receives queries in natural language and retrieves snippets,
which are assessed not only for their functionality but also for their readability.
The snippets are grouped according to their used API calls (libraries), thus
enabling the developer to determine which solution is best fitted for his/her
own source code, and making sure that it will be easily integrated and maintained.
Upon providing a preliminary evaluation of our methodology on a set of different
programming queries, we conclude that it can be effective in providing reusable
and readable source code snippets.
