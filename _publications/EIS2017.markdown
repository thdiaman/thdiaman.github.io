Enhancing the requirements elicitation process has always been of added value to software engineers,
since it expedites the software lifecycle and reduces errors in the conceptualization phase of 
software products. The challenge posed to the research community is to construct formal models that 
are capable of storing requirements from multimodal formats (text and UML diagrams) and promote easy 
requirements reuse, while at the same time being traceable to allow full control of the system design, 
as well as comprehensible to software engineers and end users. In this work, we present an approach 
that enhances requirements reuse while capturing the static (functional requirements, use case diagrams) 
and dynamic (activity diagrams) view of software projects. Our ontology-based approach allows for 
reasoning over the stored requirements, while the mining methodologies employed detect incomplete 
or missing software requirements, this way reducing the effort required for requirements elicitation 
at an early stage of the project lifecycle.
