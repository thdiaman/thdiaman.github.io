Contemporary software development processes involve finding reusable software 
components from online repositories and integrating them to the source code, both to 
reduce development time and to ensure that the final software project is of high 
quality. Although several systems have been designed to automate this procedure by 
recommending components that cover the desired functionality, the reusability of these 
components is usually not assessed by these systems. In this work, we present QualBoa, 
a recommendation system for source code components that covers both the functional and 
the quality aspects of software component reuse. Upon retrieving components, QualBoa 
provides a ranking that involves not only functional matching to the query, but also a 
reusability score based on configurable thresholds of source code metrics. The 
evaluation of QualBoa indicates that it can be effective for recommending reusable 
source code.
