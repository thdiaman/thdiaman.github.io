The field of Intelligent Transportation Systems has lately raised increasing interest 
due to its high socio-economic impact. This work aims on developing efficient techniques 
for traffic congestion prediction and visualisation. We have designed a simple, yet 
effective and scalable model to handle sparse data from GPS observations and reduce the 
problem of congestion prediction to a binary classification problem (jam, non-jam). An 
attempt to generalise the problem is performed by exploring the impact of discriminative 
versus generative classifiers when employed to produce results in a 30-minute interval 
ahead of present time. In addition, we present a novel congestion prediction algorithm 
based on using correlation metrics to improve feature selection. Concerning the 
visualisation of traffic jams, we present a traffic jam visualisation approach based on 
cluster analysis that identifies dense congestion areas.
