As developers often use third-party libraries to facilitate software development, the
lack of proper API documentation for these libraries undermines their reuse potential.
And although several approaches extract usage examples for libraries, they are usually
tied to specific language implementations, while their produced examples are often
redundant and are not presented as concise and readable snippets. In this work, we
propose a novel approach that extracts API call sequences from client source code and
clusters them to produce a diverse set of source code snippets that effectively covers
the target API. We further construct a summarization algorithm to present concise and
readable snippets to the users. Upon evaluating our system on software libraries, we
indicate that it achieves high coverage in API methods, while the produced snippets
are of high quality and closely match handwritten examples.
