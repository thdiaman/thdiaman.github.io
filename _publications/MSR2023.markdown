Current state of practice dictates that software developers host their projects online and 
employ project management systems to monitor the development of product features, keep track 
of bugs, and prioritize task assignments. The data stored in these systems, if their semantics 
are extracted effectively, can be used to answer several interesting questions, such as finding 
who is the most suitable developer for a task, what the priority of a task should be, or even 
what is the actual workload of the software team. To support researchers and practitioners that 
work towards these directions, we have built a system that crawls data from the Jira management 
system, performs topic modeling on the data to extract useful semantics and stores them in a 
practical database schema. We have used our system to retrieve and analyze 656 projects of the 
Apache Software Foundation, comprising data from more than a million Jira issues.
