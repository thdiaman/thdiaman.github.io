As the popularity of the JavaScript language is constantly increasing, one of the most
important challenges today is to assess the quality of JavaScript packages. Developers
often employ tools for code linting and for the extraction of static analysis metrics
in order to assess and/or improve their code. In this context, we have developed
npn-miner, a platform that crawls the npm registry and analyzes the packages using
static analysis tools in order to extract detailed quality metrics as well as
high-level quality attributes, such as maintainability and security. Our infrastructure
includes an index that is accessible through a web interface, while we have also
constructed a dataset with the results of a detailed analysis for 2000 popular npm packages.
