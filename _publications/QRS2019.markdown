When developers search online to find software components to reuse, they usually
first need to understand the container projects/libraries, and subsequently identify
the required functionality. Several approaches identify and summarize the offerings
of projects from their source code, however they often require that the developer has
knowledge of the underlying topic modeling techniques; they do not provide a mechanism
for tuning the number of topics, and they offer no control over the top terms for each
topic. In this work, we use a vectorizer to extract information from variable/method
names and comments, and apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation to cluster the source code
files of a project into different semantic topics. The number of topics is optimized
based on their purity with respect to project packages, while topic categories are
constructed to provide further intuition and Stack Exchange tags are used to express
the topics in more abstract terms.
