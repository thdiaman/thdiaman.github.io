In contemporary energy markets participants interact with each other via brokers that 
are responsible for the proper energy flow to and from their clients (usually in the 
form of long-term or short-term contracts). Power TAC is a realistic simulation of a 
real-life energy market, aiming towards providing a better understanding and modeling of 
modern energy markets, while boosting research on innovative trading strategies. Power 
TAC models brokers as software agents, competing against each other in Double Auction 
environments, in order to increase their client base and market share. Current work 
discusses such a broker agent architecture, striving to maximize his own profit. Within 
the context of our analysis, Double Auction markets are treated as microeconomic systems 
and, based on state-of-the-art price formation strategies, the following policies are 
designed: an adaptive price formation policy, a policy for forecasting energy 
consumption that employs Time Series Analysis primitives, and two shout update policies, 
a rule-based policy that acts rather hastily, and one based on Fuzzy Logic. The results 
are quite encouraging and will certainly call for future research.
