Nowadays, developers rely on online sources to find example snippets that address the 
programming problems they are trying to solve. However, contemporary API usage mining 
methods are not suitable for locating easily reusable snippets, as they provide usage 
examples for specific APIs, thus requiring the developer to know which library to use 
beforehand. On the other hand, the approaches that retrieve snippets from online sources 
usually output a list of examples, without aiding the developer to distinguish among 
different implementations and without offering any insight on the quality and the 
reusability of the proposed snippets. In this work, we present CodeCatch, a system that 
receives queries in natural language and extracts snippets from multiple online sources. 
The snippets are assessed both for their quality and for their usefulness/preference by 
the developers, while they are also clustered according to their API calls to allow the 
developer to select among the different implementations. Preliminary evaluation of 
CodeCatch in a set of indicative programming problems indicates that it can be a useful 
tool for the developer.
