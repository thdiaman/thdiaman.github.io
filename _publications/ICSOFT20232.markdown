Lately, online issue tracking systems like Jira are used extensively for monitoring
open-source software projects. Using these systems, different contributors can
collaborate towards planning features and resolving issues that may arise during
the software development process. In this context, several approaches have been
proposed to extract knowledge from these systems in order to automate issue
assignment. Though effective under certain scenarios, these approaches also have
limitations; most of them are based mainly on textual features and they may use
techniques that do not extract the underlying semantics and/or the expertise of
the different contributors. Furthermore, they typically provide black-box
recommendations, thus not helping the developers to interpret the issue assignments.
In this work, we present an issue mining system that extracts semantic topics from
issues and provides interpretable recommendations for issue assignments. Our system
employs a dataset of Jira issues and extracts information not only from the textual
features of issues but also from their components and their labels. These features,
along with the extracted semantic topics, produce an aggregated model that outputs
interpretable recommendations and useful statistics to support issue assignment.
The results of our evaluation indicate that our system can be effective, leaving
room for future research.
