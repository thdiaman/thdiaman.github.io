In order to maintain, extend or reuse software projects one has to primarily understand 
what a system does and how well it does it. And, while in some cases information on 
system functionality exists, information covering the non-functional aspects is usually 
unavailable. Thus, one has to infer such knowledge by extracting design patterns 
directly from the source code. Several tools have been developed to identify design 
patterns, however most of them are limited to compilable and in most cases executable 
code, they rely on complex representations, and do not offer the developer any control 
over the detected patterns. In this paper we present DP-CORE, a design pattern detection 
tool that defines a highly descriptive representation to detect known and define custom 
patterns. DP-CORE is flexible, identifying exact and approximate pattern versions even 
in non-compilable code. Our analysis indicates that DP-CORE provides an efficient 
alternative to existing design pattern detection tools.
