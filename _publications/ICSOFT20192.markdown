Lately, the popular open source paradigm and the adoption of agile methodologies
have changed the way software is developed. Effective collaboration within software
teams has become crucial for building successful products. In this context, harnessing
the data available in online code hosting facilities can help towards understanding
how teams work and optimizing the development process. Although there are several
approaches that mine contributions' data, they usually view contributors as a uniform
body of engineers, and focus mainly on the aspect of productivity while neglecting the
quality of the work performed. In this work, we design a methodology for identifying
engineer roles in development teams and determine the behaviors that prevail for each
role. Using a dataset of GitHub projects, we perform clustering against the DevOps axis,
thus identifying three roles: developers that are mainly preoccupied with code commits,
operations engineers that focus on task assignment and accep tance testing, and the
lately popular role of DevOps engineers that are a mix of both. Our analysis further
extracts behavioral patterns for each role, this way assisting team leaders in knowing
their team and effectively directing responsibilities to achieve optimal workload
balancing and task allocation.
