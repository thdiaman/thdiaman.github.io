The continuously improving capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are rapidly
establishing them as the de facto choice for complex tasks and sophisticated reasoning. Evaluation
tasks, for example, are particularly challenging, since they demand expert judgment, contextual
analysis, and nuanced decision-making. Educational assessment represents a critical instance of
such a complex cognitive task, where scalability challenges force institutions to choose between
efficiency and assessment quality, as enrollment outpaces faculty capacity. While large language
models seem promising for assisting in this context, they often lack domain-specific knowledge and
pedagogical context, which are essential for effective assessment. This paper presents a systematic
methodology for human-AI collaboration that addresses these limitations and achieves scalable
efficiency, while preserving instructor autonomy. We validate our approach in the Software
Engineering education domain, an especially demanding testbed, which requires assessment across
multiple technical artifacts that combine objective correctness with subjective design quality. The
system is tested against 30 software engineering projects, across different software engineering
artifact types. Our evaluation demonstrates significant efficiency improvement against the current
(manual) assessment approach, indicating that the systematic provision of domain knowledge can
enable AI assistance in complex educational evaluation tasks.
