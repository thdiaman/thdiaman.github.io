Software requirements are commonly written in natural language, making them prone to 
ambiguity, incompleteness and inconsistency. By converting requirements to formal 
emantic representations, emerging problems can be detected at an early stage of the 
development process, thus reducing the number of ensuing errors and the development 
costs. In this paper, we treat the mapping from requirements to formal representations 
as a semantic parsing task. We describe a novel data set for this task that involves two 
contributions: first, we establish an ontology for formally representing requirements; 
and second, we introduce an iterative annotation scheme, in which formal representations 
are derived through step-wise refinements.
