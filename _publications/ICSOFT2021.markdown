With the help of project management tools and code hosting facilities, software
development has been transformed into an easy-to-decentralize business. However,
determining the importance of tasks within a software engineering process in order
to better prioritize and act on has always been an interesting challenge. Although
several approaches on bug severity/priority prediction exist, the challenge of task
importance prediction has not been sufficiently addressed in current research. Most
approaches do not consider the meta-data and the temporal characteristics of the
data, while they also do not take into account the ordinal characteristics of the
importance/severity variable. In this work, we analyze the challenge of task
importance prediction and propose a prototype methodology that extracts both textual
(titles, descriptions) and meta-data (type, assignee) characteristics from tasks and
employs a sliding window technique to model their time frame. After that, we evaluate
three different prediction methods, a multi-class classifier, a regression algorithm,
and an ordinal classification technique, in order to assess which model is the most
effective for encompassing the relative ordering between different importance values.
The results of our evaluation are promising, leaving room for future research.
