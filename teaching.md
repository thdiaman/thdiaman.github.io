In this page, one may find information about the courses that I have taught, co-taught (or taught as part of my 
teaching assistant responsibilities) over the years.

<h1>Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
<h5 style="font-style: italic;">Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</h5>
<h5 style="font-style: italic;">Academic Years teaching: 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022</h5>
<p>The aim of this course is to introduce students to object-oriented programming. It includes the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and teaches students how to model their software using UML class diagrams and how to write code in C++.
I have worked as a visiting lecturer in this course, creating the lecture slides, the lab material and the assignments, and teaching the lectures and the lab exercises.
