My name is Themistoklis Diamantopoulos and I am currently a PhD candidate at the Intelligent 
Systems &amp; Software Engineering Labgroup of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
In the following there is a little bit about me.

I received the Diploma Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the faculty school of 
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2011, after completing my thesis titled: "Design and 
Development of Auction Algorithms applied in the PowerTAC Competition".

Moreover, I continued my 
studies in the University of Edinburgh, where I received my MSc degree in Computer Science. My 
master thesis concerned the application of Machine Learning techniques (Classification, 
Reinforcement Learning) in order to develop cooperative techniques that require no prior 
coordination.

My research interests include the areas of Data Mining, Software Engineering, 
Machine Learning, and Multi-Agent Systems. I have worked as a research associate in the EU-funded 
project eCOMPASS (eCO-friendly urban Multi-modal route PlAnning Services for mobile uSers) as 
part of my work in the Informatics and Telematics Institute (ITI) of Centre for Research and 
Technology - Hellas (CERTH). After that, I worked as a research associate in the EU-funded 
project S-CASE (Scaffolding and Scalable Software Services). 
In the meantime, I have begun my PhD research in the field of applying Data Mining techniques on 
Software Engineering data at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Currently I continue 
working on my PhD thesis, while also working in project SEAF (Sustainable Energy Asset Evaluation and Optimisation Frameworks)
