Hi and welcome to my personal website. My name is Themistoklis Diamantopoulos and
I am currently a PhD candidate at the Intelligent Systems &amp; Software Engineering
Labgroup of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

My research interests include the areas of Data Mining, Software Engineering,
Machine Learning, and Multi-Agent Systems. I have worked and still work in
different EU-funded projects and I actively pursuit a PhD in order to satisfy
these interests.

I am also an active developer in Java, Python, R, Javascript, etc. and have
experience in several frameworks and libraries. You can find most information
about me and my work by checking this website, however you can also check my
