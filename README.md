My Personal Website created using Jekyll

This website is created using a static site generator named <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>
and originally used the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template">Steve's No-Good-Very-Bad Jekyll Theme</a>,
which --by the way-- is actually quite good.
The site is hosted using <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
and you can even check its source in a GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thdiaman/thdiaman.github.io">repo</a>.
